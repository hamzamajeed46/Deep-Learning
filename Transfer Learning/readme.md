This notebook demonstrates a Transfer Learning workflow using a pre-trained model for image classification tasks. It covers data preprocessing, model customization, fine-tuning, and performance evaluation. The notebook is designed to utilize GPU acceleration for faster training. The last cell addresses common GPU-related issues, such as out-of-memory errors, and provides potential solutions. Ensure that the required dependencies are installed, and the runtime environment is properly configured before execution.
